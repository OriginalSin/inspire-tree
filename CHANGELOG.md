# Changes to Inspire Tree

- @todo move util-type methods to a lib file?
- @todo look into bucket performance problem

- @todo add types to remaining properties/methods
- @todo publish changes to babel add module export plugin somewhere

- `expandParents` no longer mapped to the `tree` api since it's useless at the root level.

# 1.9.1

- Fixed css somehow missed by deploy script.

# 1.9

- Added support for `a.attributes` primarily to allow for custom `href`s.
- Added `icon-folder-open`.
- Added hierarchy lines which can be disabled by excluding the `hierarchy.scss` file when building.
- Revamped default theme icons and colors.

**Breaking Changes**

- `icon-caret` has been removed in favor of `icon-expand` and `icon-collapse` which also removes the rotation.

# 1.8

- Added `preventTreeDefault` to DOM-related events `node.click`, `node.dblclick`, and `node.contextmenu`.
- Added pointer for the default handler to DOM-related events, as the third argument.
- Added support for non-tree DOM elements as drop targets.
- Allowed custom classnames from `node.itree.li.attributes.class` or `node.itree.li.attributes.classNames`.

**Breaking Changes**

To allow for event overrides, DOM events fire *before* the Inspire Tree logic has executed. For example
in 1.7, if you check `node.expanded()` inside a `node.dblclick` listener it would reflect the result
of the double click. Now, it will return the *current* value, before the click handler logic has executed.

# 1.7

- Changed `extract` to make use of `addNode` for hierarchy merges.
- Prevented `insertAt` from overwriting an array with a boolean for `children` when merging.
- Added `disableDirectDeselection` configuration option.
- Added `invoke` and `invokeDeep` methods to `TreeNodes`.
- Improved performance of `TreeNodes.nodes`.

**Breaking Changes**

- Removed second `context` argument to `tree.node` and `tree.nodes`, as they now operate from `TreeNodes`.

# 1.6.1

- Added `src` directory to npm include list.
- `search` will skip soft-removed nodes.
- Fixed clones being shallow.

# 1.6

- Added `selection.autoSelectChildren` option to also set selected state of child nodes when parent is selected.
- Added `tree.isNode` method.
- Added `TreeNode.interdeterminate` method.
- Added `TreeNodes.addNode()` method to add a node to a collection. If a sort method is defined, it will insert at the correction position.
- Added `TreeNodes.context()` method to return the parent node or tree context.
- Added `TreeNodes.each()` method for chain-friendly node iteration.
- Added `TreeNodes.insertAt()` method which inserts a node at a given index or merges existing.
- Added `TreeNodes.tree()` method to allow cleaner chain context changes.
- Added `showCheckboxes` configuration option.
- Added defaults to custom render objects to allow for undefined methods.
- Cleaned which files are ignore for both npm/bower packages.
- Fixed interdeterminate/deselection logic/state/dom issues.
- Mapped `expanded`, `selectable`, and `visible` filter methods on TreeNodes.
- Removed internal mergeNode method, in favor of smarter `addNode`/`insertAt` methods.
- Replaced `tree.addNode` with a mapping to `TreeNodes.addNode`. The method signature is unchanged.
- Separate checkbox visuals and checkbox selection mode for finer control over behaviors.

**Breaking Changes**

- Changed `tree.reload()` to return the `tree.load` promise instead of the tree instance.
- Changed `TreeNode.copyHierarchy` to exclude hidden children (when `excludeNode` is false).
- Moved `allowSelection` configuration option to `selection.allow`.
- Moved `autoDeselect` configuration option to `selection.autoDeselect`.
- Moved `multiselect` configuration option to `selection.multiple`.
- Moved `requireSelection` configuration option to `selection.require`.
- Moved `checkbox` configuration option to `selection.mode: 'checkbox'`.
- `TreeNode.restore` may now reset the node's state - this must be enabled via config option `nodes.resetStateOnRestore`.
- `TreeNode.softRemove` no longer resets a node's state.
- Removed `dist/scss` files in favor of including `src` and `img` directories.

# 1.5

Note: 1.5 was quickly unpublished because it became clear that our logic for a new feature wasn't acceptable. All of these changes appear in 1.6.

- Added `tree.canAutoDeselect` method.
- Added `autoSelectChildren` option.

**Breaking Changes**

- Replaced `tree.preventDeselection` boolean with `tree.enableDeselection` and `tree.disableDeselection` methods.

# 1.4.5

- Updated data loader to accept a returned promise as an alternative to resolve/reject arguments.
- Updated all tree methods without a return value to return the tree instance.
- Added `mute` and `unmute` methods to surpress events.
- Added `unselectable` attribute for IE, cancel on click event to prevent text selection.
- Fixed nodes remaining focused when tree itself is blurred.
- Changed focus styling to use dotted outline instead of hover color.

# 1.4.4

- Fixed `selectBetween` failing when a range of two nodes was selected.

# 1.4.3

- Added `tree.lastSelectedNode()`.
- Updated shift+select logic to use last selected node, to allow for separate ranges.
- Fixed bug with `selectBetween` including the end node.

# 1.4.2

- Disabled text selection via css for a cleaner experience.
- Added `boundingNodes` methods to return min/max nodes.
- `search` now treats undefined arguments as empty queries.
- Minor cleanup.

# 1.4.1

- Added `TreeNode.context` method to get it's immediate `TreeNodes` context.
- Added `TreeNode.indexPath` method to get a key of all parent context indices.
- Added `tree.selectBetween` method for selecting all nodes between a start and end node.
- Added ranged selection via shift key.
- Added logic to clear text selection after a double or shift-click.
- Mapped `setSelectable` to TreeNodes (shallow and deep copies).
- Fixed performance problems with `export` and `copyHierarchy`.
- `expand` resolves promise immediately if already expanded.
- Minor repo cleanup.

# 1.4.0

- Internal and repo cleanup.

**Breaking Changes**

- Moves bundled lodash to a `-bundled` distribution file. `inspire-tree.js` and its variants require lodash as an external dependency.

# 1.3.0

- Added `setSelectable`.

**Breaking Changes**

- `load`, `expand`, and `expandDeep` now return a Promise.

# 1.2.6

- Minor cleanup, package updates

# 1.2.5

- Updated to lodash v4
- Internal cleanup, methods make use of own recursion functions.

# 1.2.4

- Load event now fires even when data is an array.
- Recursion functions end when `false` is returned.

# 1.2.3

- Renamed `selectFirstVisibleNode` -> `selectFirstAvailableNode`
- Added `TreeNodes.get` method.
- Internal cleanup.

# 1.2.2

- Renamed `filter` to `extract`, add `filter` method.
- Fixed `flatten` treatment of arguments.

# 1.2.1

- `filter` returns TreeNodes instead of an Array.
- Removed `reduce` in favor of `filter`.

# 1.2.0

- Fixed TreeNode methods missing return.
- Deepest excludes nodes with `children: true`;
- Cleanup/internal fixes.

# 1.1.0

- Removed `softRemoveDeep`, `softRemove` must be recursive by default.
- Recurse methods no longer require return.
- Removed `tree.showAll` since tree.showDeep exists.
- Internal cleanup.
